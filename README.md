Build instructions
==================

This client is a standard android studio project.

If you want to compile it in command line with gradle, go to the project directory:

Debug mode:

`./gradlew assembleDebug`

Release mode:

`./gradlew assembleRelease`

And it should build the project (you need to have the right android SDKs)

Recompile the provided aar files until we have gradle
======================================================

generate olm-sdk.aar
--------------------

sh build_olm_lib.sh

generate matrix-sdk.aar
----------------------

sh build_matrix_sdk_lib.sh

generate the other aar files
----------------------

sh build_jitsi_libs.sh

compile the matrix SDK with the Far Citizen-android project
----------------------

sh set_debug_env.sh

Make your own flavour
=====================

Let says your application is named MyRiot : You have to create your own flavour.

Modify riot-android/vector/build.gradle
---------------------------------------

In "productFlavors" section, duplicate "app" group if you plan to use FCM or "appfdroid" if don't.

for example, with FCM, it would give

```
     app {
            applicationId 'ms.messageapp.alpha'
            // use the version name
            versionCode rootProject.ext.versionCodeProp
            versionName rootProject.ext.versionNameProp
            buildConfigField "boolean", "ALLOW_FCM_USE", "true"
            buildConfigField "String", "SHORT_FLAVOR_DESCRIPTION", "\"G\""
            buildConfigField "String", "FLAVOR_DESCRIPTION", "\"GooglePlay\""
        }
```

- if you use FCM, duplicate appImplementation at the end of this file and replace appImplementation by appmyriotImplementation.
- if you don't, update the "if (!getGradle().getStartParameter().getTaskRequests().toString().contains("fdroid"))" to include your flavor.

Create your flavour directory
-----------------------------

- Copy riot-android/vector/src/app or appfroid if you use FCM or you donâ€™t.
- Rename it to appmyriot.
- If you use FCM, you will need to generate your own google-services.json.

Customise your flavour
----------------------

- Open riot-android/vector/src/appmyriot/AndroidManifest.xml
- Change the application name to myRiot with "android:label="Far Citizen" and "tools:replace="label"" in the application tag.
- Any other field can be customised by adding the resources in this directory classpath.
- Open Android studio, select your flavour.
- Build and run the app : you made your first Far Citizen app.

You will need to manage your own provider because "im.vector" is already used (look at VectorContentProvider to manage it).
